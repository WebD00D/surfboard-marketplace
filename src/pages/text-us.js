    BoardTexts is an SMS-based service powered by the Boardgrab staff (no robots here).

    All you have to do is send us a message and we will text you back and solve all of your board finding problems. It’s free, and it’s #notabot.
    <br/><br/>
    Because BoardTexts is a) awesome and b) in high demand, it’s currently in “beta” which basically just means it’s not perfect yet, so be nice to us.
